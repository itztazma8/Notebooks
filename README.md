This page will contain all the machine learning/data science projects

## 1. Sleep Analysis
### A set of tasks related to data cleaning and formatting. Extracting different data from an existing data frame. <br>[_Project Link_](https://github.com/itztazma8/Notebooks/tree/main/Sleep_Analysis)

## 2. Car Purchase Prediction
### Using KNN model, this prediction is done to determine the chance of buying a car. For this, all the car features have been used along with prices. <br>[_Project Link_](https://github.com/itztazma8/Notebooks/tree/main/Car%20Purchase%20Prediction)

## 3. Store Sales Prediction
### A store sales prediction system made using Logistic Regression based on data collected on a monthly basis. <br>[_Project Link_](https://github.com/itztazma8/Notebooks/tree/main/Store%20Sales%20Predictor)

## 4. Fake Bills Prediction
### Using K-means clustering algorithm, fake bills are predicted using numerical measurements of the bills only. The project can be further enhanced with addition of images mapped along the entries. <br> [_Project Link_](https://github.com/itztazma8/Notebooks/tree/main/Fake%20Bills%20Prediction)


## 5. Profession Prediction
### In this case, we first analyze the data properly. After finding the results doing EDA, we cluster the professions based on different metrics like- annual income, gender, spending score and so on. <br> [_Project Link_](https://github.com/itztazma8/Notebooks/tree/main/Profession%20Prediction)
